Ojai wants you to come visit. Ten hotels in the Ventura County mountain town are giving travelers a way to use their vacation dollars to help the community recover from December’s devastating Thomas fire. Ojai Love gives visitors 10% off room prices as well as 10% off prices at 50 local restaurants, shops and services. Participating hotels make a $10 donation every night you stay to help victims of the fire. (Of course, you can make an additional donation at Help of Ojai.) Also, visitors receive an Ojai Love cap (two per reservation) and pins to show their support. The offer is good for stays through March 31. The Ojai Valley Inn’s discounted rooms, for example, start at $324. The boutique hotel Emerald Iguana Inn discount rooms start at $125. Those who stay under the Ojai Love hotel package can pick up an I Love Ojai Box — filled with locally made honey, cookies, granola, bread, jam and notecards — at the Knead Baking Co. for $99 instead of $110. Jewelers, rock-climbing outfitters, bookstores and tasting rooms are among the businesses taking part in the campaign. The Ojai Valley Inn reopened Tuesday. It had been closed for a month for “a comprehensive cleaning and rehabilitation,” according to a news release, because of the massive fire that spread to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Wellness resort the Oaks at Ojai remains closed to continue cleaning up smoke damage. Check out the full list of participating Ojai Love hotels and businesses.  Here’s a list of what’s open, what’s closed as a result of the deadly mudslides in the Montecito area. travel@latimes.com @latimestravel
